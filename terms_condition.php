               <h4 class="text-blue font-600">Protection of client money</h4>
               <p>By being regulated by the SVG government, clients get the assurance that they are protected under a world-leading jurisdiction. The SVG 'Client Assets Rules' require Optimum Standard International Group (SVG) Limited to segregate all funds on a daily basis and hold these funds in a separate account held at a bank approved by the SVG government. We will hold these funds as trustees. As a result the approved bank or any other creditor of Optimum Standard International Group (SVG) Limited will not be in a position to claim these funds in case of liquidation of Optimum Standard International Group (SVG) Limited.
</p>
<p>This also means that your funds and other assets will be segregated from Optimum Standard International Group (SVG) Limited's own money and will not be available to us for use in the course of our business. We may hold your money and the money of other clients in a pooled bank account. Hence, in the event of a default by the bank causing any unreconciled shortfall in the money held in the pooled account, then you may share proportionately in that shortfall. The company maintains operational and client bank accounts with reputable financial institutions. All funds, whether they are classified as company funds or client funds, are kept in the safest top-tier banks.
</p>
               <h4 class="text-blue font-600">Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)</h4>
              <p>
              All customers benefit from the SVG government scheme. Payments under the protected investment business scheme are limited to a maximum of $1,00,000.00 per customer. The Scheme is set up mainly to assist retail individuals, although smaller businesses are also covered.
