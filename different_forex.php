                    <h4>Forex trading strategies that work #1 — Position trading</h4>
                    <p>Position trading is a longer-term trading approach where you can hold trades for weeks or even months. The time frames you’ll trade on are usually Daily or Weekly. As a position trader, you mainly rely on fundamental analysis in your forex trading (like NFP, GDP, Retail sales, and etc.) to give a bias. Also, you might use technical analysis to better time your entries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Let’s say:</strong></p>
                    <p>You analyze the fundamentals of EUR/USD and determine it’s bullish. But, you don’t want to go long at any price. So, you wait for EUR/USD to come to Support before taking your position. Now if your analysis is correct, you could enter at the start of a new trend before anyone else.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/image1.png"></p>
                    <p>Now, let’s discuss the pros and cons of position trading -</p>
                    <p><strong>The pros:</strong></p>
                    <p>Don’t need to spend much time trading because your trades are long-term and less stress in your forex trading as you’re not concerned with the short-term price fluctuations. A favorable risk to reward on your trades (possibly 1 to 5 or more).</p>
                    <p><strong>The cons:</strong></p>
                    <p>Requires a firm understanding of fundamentals driving the market. Need a larger capital base because your stop loss is wide . May not make a profit every year because of the low number of trades And lastly, there’s a trading strategy called Trend Following (which is similar to position trading). The only difference is Trend Following is purely a technical approach that doesn’t use any fundamentals.</p>
                    <h4>Forex trading strategies that work #2 — Swing trading</h4>
                    <p>As a swing trader, your concern is to capture “a single move” in the market (otherwise called a swing). So you’ll likely:</p>
                    <p><strong>Buy Support</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Sell Resistance</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Trade breakouts</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Trade pullbacks</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Trade the bounce of the moving average</strong></p>
                    <p>Thus, it’s important to learn technical concepts like Support & Resistance, candlestick patterns, and moving average.</p>
                    <p>Here’s an example of swing trading on USD/JPY:</p>
                    <p><img src="images/image2.png"></p>
                    <p>Now, let’s discuss the pros and cons of swing trading.</p>
                   <p><strong>The Pros:</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to quit your full-time job to be a forex swing trader. It’s possible to be profitable every year because you have more trading opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>The Cons:
</strong></p>
<p>Won’t be able to ride big trends. Have overnight risk . Now, if you want to learn more about swing trading, then The Complete Guide to Finding High Probability Trading Strategy will help immensely.</p>
<h4>Forex trading strategies that work #3 — Day trading</h4>

<p>Day trading a short-term trading strategy where you’ll hold your trades for minutes or even hours (it’s similar to swing trading but at a “faster” pace).</p>

<p>The time frames you’ll trade on are usually the 5 mins or 15 mins.</p>

<p>As a day trader, your concern is to capture the intraday volatility.</p>

<p>This means you must trade the most volatile session of your instrument because that’s where the money is made.</p>

<p>So, you’ll likely:</p>

<p><strong>Buy Support</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sell Resistance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Trade breakouts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Trade pullbacks</strong></p>

<p><strong>Trade the bounce of the moving average</strong></p>

<p>Now, if you’re a day trader, you won’t be concerned with the fundamentals of the economy or the long-term trend because it’s irrelevant. Instead, you’ll identify your bias for the day (whether to be long or short) and trade that direction for the session.</p>

<p><strong>An example:</strong></p>

<p>Below is the chart of USDCAD (4-hour timeframe) at 1.2900 Resistance. If the price can’t break above it, chances are, today will be a “down” day.</p>


<p><img src="images/image16.png"></p>

<p>Next… On the 15-minute timeframe, you noticed a Shooting Star has formed which signals selling pressure. You can take a short trade with possible target profit at Support (blue box).</p>

<p><strong>The pros:</strong></p>

<p>If you’re good at forex , you can make money in most months. No overnight risk because you close your positions by the end of the day.</p>

<p><strong>The cons:</strong></p>

<p>It’s stressful as you’re constantly watching the markets. Can lose a lot more than intended if you suffer massive slippage (from Black Swan events). Huge opportunity cost as you could be earning a full-time salary elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now if day trading is still too “slow” for you, then the next forex trading strategy might suit you:</p>

<h4>Forex trading strategies that work #4 — Scalping</h4>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong></p>

<p>I don’t recommend scalping for the retail traders because the transaction cost will eat up most of your profits and you’re slower than the machines which put you at a major disadvantage.</p>

<p>Still, if you want to learn more:</p>

<p>Scalping is a very short-term strategy where you’ll hold forex trades for minutes or even seconds. As a scalper, your concern with what the market is doing now and how you can take advantage of it.</p>

<p>The main tool you’ll use to trade is order flow (which shows you the buy and sell orders in the market).</p>

<p><strong>An example:</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/image8.png"></p>

<p><strong>The pros</strong></p>

<p>Have lots of trading opportunities each day. Can make a healthy income from trading.</p>

<p><strong>The cons</strong></p>

<p>High financial cost (paying your software, newsfeed, connection, and etc.) . Glued to the screen for many hours a day It’s a highly stressful endeavor. Lastly, if you want to be a scalper, I recommend you join a proprietary trading firm because they will provide the tools to help you with it.</p>


<h4>Forex trading strategies that work #5 — Transition trading</h4>

<p>You’ve probably never heard of this before because I came up with it.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s how:</strong></p>

<p>Back while I was in proprietary trading, one of the “interesting” things I learned was transition trading.</p>

<p>You’re probably wondering: “What is transition trading?”</p>

<p>Well, the idea is to enter a trade on the lower timeframe, and if the market moves in your favor, you can increase your target profit or trail your stop loss on the higher timeframe.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p>Let’s say you traded the breakout on GBP/JPY 1-hour timeframe and the price quickly went in your favor Now:</p>


<p><img src="images/image23.png"></p>


<p>You noticed the 4-hour timeframe respecting the 20MA. So instead of taking profits, you trail your stop loss using the 20MA hoping to ride a bigger move. And if you’re wrong, you’ll exit your trade when the price closes below the 20MA.</p>

<p>Now, there are variations of transition trading. But the main idea is this:</p>

<p>Find an entry on the lower timeframe If the price moves in your favor, consider planning your exits on the higher timeframe.</p>


<p><strong>The pros:</strong></p>

<p>Can get an insane risk to reward (possibly 1 to 10 or more).  Can lower your risk as your entry is on the lower timeframe.</p>

<p><strong>The cons:</strong></p>

<p>Only a handful of your trades will lead to monster winners. Must understand multiple timeframes really well.</p>
