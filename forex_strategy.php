                  <p><strong>What is Forex Trading Strategy?</strong></p> 

<p>A forex trading strategy is a technique used by a forex trader to determine whether to buy or sell a currency pair at any given time. Forex trading strategies can be based on technical analysis, chart analysis or fundamental, news-based events. The forex traderâ€™s currency trading strategy is usually made up of trading signals that trigger buy or sell decisions. Forex trading strategies are available on the internet or may be developed by traders themselves.</p>

<p><strong>BREAKING DOWN Forex Trading Strategy</strong></p>

<p>Forex trading strategies can be either manual or automated methods for generating trading signals. Manual systems involve a trader sitting in front of a computer screen, looking for trading signals and interpreting whether to buy or sell. Automated systems involve a trader developing an algorithm that finds trading signals and executes trades on its own. The latter systems take human emotion out of the equation and may improve performance.</p>

<p>Traders should exercise caution when purchasing off-the-shelf forex trading strategies since it is difficult to verify their track record and many successful trading systems are kept secret.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Forex Trading Strategy</strong></p>

<p>Many forex traders begin developing a trading strategy by starting with something simple. For example, they may notice that a specific currency pair tends to rebound from a particular support or resistance level. They may then decide to add other elements that improve the accuracy of these trading signals over time. For instance, they may require that the price rebound from a specific support level by a certain percentage or number of pips.</p>

<p>There are several different components to an effective forex trading strategy:</p>

<p><strong>Selecting the Market: </strong>Traders must determine what currency pairs they trade and become experts at reading those currency pairs.</p>

<p><strong>Position Sizing:</strong>Traders must determine how large each position is to control for the amount of risk taken in each individual trade.</p> 

<p><strong>Entry Points: </strong>Traders must develop rules governing when to enter a long or short position in a given currency pair.</p>

<p><strong>Exit Points: </strong>Traders must develop rules telling them when to exit a long or short position, as well as when to get out of a losing position.</p>

<p><strong>Trading Tactics:</strong>Traders should have set rules for how to buy and sell currency pairs, including selecting the right execution technologies.</p> 

<p>Traders should consider developing trading systems in programs like MetaTrader that make it easy to automate rule-following. In addition, these applications let traders backtest trading strategies to see how they would have performed in the past.</p>

<p><strong>When Is It Time to Change Strategies?</strong></p>

<p>A forex trading strategy works really well when traders follow the rules. But just like anything else, one particular strategy may not always be a one-size-fits-all approach, so what works today may not necessarily work tomorrow. If a strategy isn't proving to be profitable and isn't producing the desired results, traders may consider the following before changing a game plan:</p>

<p>Matching the risk management with the trading style: If the risk vs. reward ratio isn't suitable, it may be cause to change strategies.</p>

<p>Market conditions evolve: A trading strategy may depend on specific market trends, so if those change, a particular strategy may become obsolete. That could signal the need to make tweaks or modifications.</p>

<p>Comprehension: If a trader doesn't quite understand the strategy, there's a good chance it won't work. If a problem comes up or a trader doesn't know the rules, the effectiveness of the strategy is lost.</p>

<p>Although change can be good, changing a forex trading strategy too often can be costly. If you modify your strategy too often, you could lose out.</p>

<p>A forex trading strategy can be purchased off-the-shelf or developed internally. Traders developing their own trading systems should be sure to backtest them and paper trade them to ensure that they perform well before committing real capital. Traders should also be sure to paper trade any strategies to ensure that they work in real life, even if they showed signs of success in backtesting and on a theoretical level.</p>

<p>50-Pips a Day Forex Strategy</p>

<p><img src="images/image4.png" alt="50-Pips a Day Forex Strategy"/></p>

<p>This strategy leverages early market moves of certain highly liquid currency pairs. The GBPUSD and EURUSD currency pairs are some of the best currencies to trade using this particular strategy. After the 7am GMT candlestick closes, traders place two positions or two opposite pending orders. When one of them gets activated by price movements, the other position is automatically cancelled. The profit target is set at 50 pips, and the stop-loss order is placed anywhere between 5 and 10 pips above or below the 7am GMT candlestick, after its formation. This is implemented to manage risk. After these conditions are set, it is now up to the market to take over the rest. Day Trading and Scalping are both short-term trading strategies. However, remember that shorter term implies greater risk, so it is essential to ensure effective risk management.</p>

<p><strong>Forex Daily Charts Strategy</strong></p>

<p><img src="images/image5.png" alt="Forex Daily Charts Strategy"/></p>

<p>The best forex traders swear by daily charts over more short-term strategies. Compared to the forex 1-hour trading strategy, or even those with lower time-frames, there is less market noise involved with daily charts. Such charts can give you over 100 pips a day due to their longer timeframe, which has the potential to result in some of the best forex trades. The trade signals are more reliable, and the potential for profit is much greater. Traders also don't need to be concerned about daily news and random price fluctuations.
</p>
<p><strong>The method is based on 3 main principles:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Locating the trend: </strong>Markets trend and consolidate, and this process repeats in cycles. The first principle of this style is to find the long drawn out moves within the forex markets. One way to identify forex trends is by studying 180 periods worth of forex data. Identifying the swing highs and lows will be the next step. By referencing this price data on the current charts, you will be able to identify the market direction.</p> 

<p><strong>Stay focused: </strong>This requires patience, and you will have to get rid of the urge to get into the market right away. You need to stay out and preserve your capital for a bigger opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Less leverage and larger stop losses: </strong>Be aware of the large intraday swings in the market. Using larger stops, however, doesn't mean putting large amounts of capital at risk.</p> 

<p>While there are plenty of trading strategy guides available for professional FX traders, the best forex strategy for consistent profits can only be achieved through extensive practice. Here are some more strategies that you can try:</p>

<p>Forex 1-Hour Trading Strategy</p>

<p><img src="images/image21.png" alt="Forex 1-Hour Trading Strategy"/></p>

<p>You can take advantage of the 60-minute time frame in this strategy. The easiest currency pairs to trade using this strategy are the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, and the AUD/USD. You would need a 100-pip momentum indicator and indicator arrows; both of which are available on MetaTrader 5.</p>


<p><strong>Buy Trade Rules:</strong></p>

<p>You can enter a long position when both of these conditions are met:</p>

<p>The 100 pips Momentum indicator triggers a buy signal when its blue line crosses the red line from below. The Indicator arrow gives a green arrow signal.</p>

<p>In this case, you can place the stop-loss below the red indicator line or the most recent support line. You can either close the trade after 30-pips, or you can also take profit when the indicator arrows give a red arrow signal.</p>

<p><strong>Sell Trade Rules:</strong></p>

<p>You can enter a short position when the following conditions are met:</p>

<p>The 100 pips Momentum indicator triggers a sell signal when its blue line crosses the red line from above. The indicator arrows give a red arrow signal.</p>

<p>Place the stop-loss above the red-indicator line, or the most recent resistance line. Close the trade after 30-pips, or when the indicator arrows give a green arrow signal.</p>
