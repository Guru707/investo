      <h2 class="text-blue font-700"> <span>TRADING PROCESS</span></h2>
      <p> The most important steps of trading are order opening and order closing to fix the results of the trade.</p>
      <p> <strong>Order Opening</strong></p>
      <p> It is possible to trade on the platform<a href="trading_platform.php">MetaTrader</a>5using either market or pending orders. Market order is used to open positions at the current time. Pending order is executed when the price reaches a certain, earlier chosen level of price. Pending orders let you trade even when you do not have an opportunity to be at your working place. After the pending order is set, it will be executed when the desired price level is reached even if the platform is closed.</p>
      <p> <strong>There are four pending orders on open positions:</strong></p>
      <p> · <strong>Buy Limit</strong>– the position to buy opens in case the Ask price becomes lower or equal to the order price (the current price level at the moment of placing an order is higher than the Buy Limit order level).</p>
      <p> · <strong>Buy Stop</strong>– the position to buy opens in case the Ask price becomes higher or equal to the order price (the current price level at the moment of placing an order is lower than the Buy Stop order level).</p>
      <p> · <strong>Sell Limit</strong>– the position to sell opens in case the Bid price becomes higher or equal to the order price (the current price level at the moment of placing an order is lower than the Sell Limit order level).</p>
      <p> · <strong>Sell Stop</strong>– the position to sell opens in case the Bid price becomes lower or equal to the order price (the current price level at the moment of placing an order is higher than the Sell Stop order level).</p>
      <p> Pending Order Placing</p>
      <p> <strong>1.</strong>Open the "New Order" tab. There are several ways to do this on MetaTrader4:</p>
      <p> o in menu "Tools" choose "New order";</p>
      <p> o in the "Terminal" block, open the "Trade" tab and right-click and choose "New Order";</p>
      <p> o click twice on the currency pair in the "Market Watch" window;</p>
      <p> o right-click on the chart and choose "Trade"– "New order";</p>
      <p> o use F9 button.</p>
      <p> <strong>2.</strong>Choose the<strong>type</strong>"Pending order" (under "comment" field). Then, you need to modify the main meanings of fields, such as:</p>
      <p> o <strong>symbol</strong>– the financial instrument that will be traded;</p>
      <p> o <strong>volume</strong>– the amount of lots;</p>
      <p> o <strong>stop loss</strong>(not necessarily)– the function of limiting losses at the indicated price;</p>
      <p> o <strong>take profit</strong>(not necessarily)– the function of fixing the profit at the indicated price;</p>
      <p> o <strong>type</strong>– the type of the pending order (buy limit, sell limit, buy stop, or sell stop);</p>
      <p> o <strong>at price</strong>– the level of the price, at which the order is to be open;</p>
      <p> o <strong>expiry</strong>(not necessarily)– the function of the cancellation of pending order (deletes pending order from the platform if it does not open until the indicated time).</p>
      <p> · <strong>3.</strong>When all the information is entered, click "Set" and after this, the pending order will show up in the "Terminal"– "Trade" window. If you want, you can modify or delete it (if it is not open yet), by right-clicking on the order in the "Terminal" window and choosing "Modify or Delete Order". You can also modify or delete pending order in one click. You can read<a href="https://justforex.com/trading/one-click-trading">here</a>how to fullfill this.</p>
      <p> <strong>Example</strong>: The bid price at USD/JPY is 109.23 at the current time, and according to your forecast, the price will increase up to USD/JPY @109.33 soon, and then, it will start falling. However, if you do not want to stay near the terminal and wait for the price that you want, you can place a pending order to sell (sell limit), which will be executed only if the price reaches the USD/JPY @109.33 level and goes down.</p>
      <p> At the moment of the pending order execution, slippages are possible.<strong>Slippage</strong>is the amount of market movements from the moment of placing the request for the order to be executed until the moment of its execution. The execution at the better or worse price than the one indicated in the order takes place.</p>
      <p> You can also place/modify pending orders directly on the chart. You can read<a href="forex-basics.html#">here</a> how to fullfil this.</p>

          <h3 >Entering the Market</span></h3>
          <p> The first step for becoming an FX trader is to open an account with a forex Broker. Brokers in these markets usually give the investors the opportunity to test their trading system and trading facilities through opening a demo account on their trading platform and start practicing buying and selling currencies.</p>
          <p> The most important aspect of FX trading is to understand the FX platforms, as they are the direct connection to the financial and forex markets. They are the software you use to place your orders, watch the market prices and also place transactions.</p>
          <p> As a trader, you would be sitting at the computer screen, looking for signals and interpreting whether to buy or sell. The main concept is to buy a product hoping to sell it on a higher price or vice versa, so that the difference is your profits, i.e. you need to buy low and sell high.</p>
          <p> Tools to get started</p>
          <p> • Computer or Smartphone</p>
          <p> • Reliable internet connection</p>
          <p> • Trading software (platform) usually made available by the broker</p>
          <p> • Trading capital</p>
          <p> • Forex Broker</p>

          <p> Fundamental analysis is a method that attempts to predict the intrinsic value of an investment. It is based on the theory that the market price of an asset tends to move towards its 'real value' or 'intrinsic value'. Fundamental traders believe that the markets will react to events in certain ways and that they can predict future market prices based on these events.</p>
          <p> Fundamental analysis in Forex entails predicting the price valuation of a currency and its market trends by analyzing current economic conditions, government policy and societal factors within a business cycle framework.</p>
          <p> Forex Traders gauge a country's economic state by examining macroeconomic indicators. When properly used, these indicators can be an invaluable resource for any Forex trader. After publication of these indicators we can observe volatility of the market. The degree of volatility is determined depending on the importance of an indicator. That is why it is important to understand which indicator is important and what it represents.</p>
